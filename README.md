Coding Bootcamp Challenge #2 - Advanced CSS

## Description

I built hello-im-elena as a starter professional coding portfolio to showcase my growing skills to potential employers. This application demonstrates my growing knowledge in HTML and CSS and includes several of the following features:

- A navigation bar linking to sections on the page and to other webpages
- Responsive elements and images
- Use of media queries to improve readability on different devices
- Pseudo-classes to make the page more dynamic

This project allowed me to work though some practical applications of advanced CSS techniques and problem solve in a highly motivating setting. Because this page is meant to represent me and my work, the drive to make it as neat and clean as possible pushed research and tweak things until I got them just right. 

As I learn more throughout the class and develop more applications, I will continue to modify this portfolio to demonstrate these skills.
